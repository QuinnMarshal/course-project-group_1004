## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

After our first group meeting, we decided to choose a dataset belonging to the medical field, as we felt that it would have the highest number of potential variables of interest which we could use for analysis. We finalized on the dataset named “Medical Cost Personal Dataset”, which contained information on the attributes of a small sample of people from the US (1338, to be exact), and their Medical Insurance Costs. We found this dataset interesting to look at since medical costs in the US have been increasing by 2-6% over the past two decades, and according to sources, approximately 22% of Americans avoid medical care due to said increase. We also found it more open to analysis as it is not too specific to a certain topic or disease. Our group hopes to analyse how a person’s basic attributes, such as age, BMI, sex, etc. affect their medical costs, as well as group people by category based on their medical costs in order to assess the cost distribution across the sample. At first glance, we suspect that the 'age' and 'BMI' columns will lead to a proportional increase in the 'charges' column, but it is difficult to speculate about any other relationships without analysis. Once we are successful with our analysis, we are confident that we will be able to construct an interactive dashboard to showcase these relationships.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset is provided by the US Census Bureau, and is used in the book, “Machine Learning with R” by Brett Lantz. It contains data on a small sample of people from different regions in the US, their basic attributes such as ‘age’, ’BMI’, ‘sex’, ‘children’, ‘smoker’ and ‘region’, along with ‘charges’, which represents the total cost of their medical insurance for the year. This data was collected through multiple National Surveys. We are not certain about the specific time and date of the collection of this data; however, we estimate it to be during 2013 as that is the year in which the book was published. The dataset was originally published for public interest and use but was utilised in the aforementioned book as a learning tool. This dataset has an Open Database Licence (ODbL 1.0), which allows for Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.
